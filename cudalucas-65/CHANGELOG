New in 2.05.1:.
   - Fixed a rounding error

New in 2.05:.
   - MersenneForum user owftheevil implemented the bitshift for FFTs

   - Restarting from previous checkpoint with a larger FFT in the case of errors
     Occurs on the fly or via keyboard input

   - Exponents from 7500 to 1100000000, depending on the card's memory

   - Cufftbench, threadbench and memtest

   - Screen output is configurable.

New in 2.04:
   - The default results file has been changed to "results.txt".

   - The worktodo line parser is now apositional, recognizing certain characters
     as only belonging to certain fields.

   - Additionally, you can now specify FFT length for a given exponent with
     (for example) "Test=N/A,expo,1444K". The FFT field must contain a K or M,
     which are interpreted the obvious way.

   - There is slightly more error checking on the command line options with an
     argument (and for some reason, the "-s" option will no longer accept a
     folder name starting with "-" :-) ).

   - The -f option will also recognize and accept lengths such as "1444K" or
     "3M", like the worktodo. However, you can specify a length the old way
     without the K, unlike on the worktodo line.

   - All FFT lengths printed are now in "1444K" format.

   - Total time for a test is now measured and printed when the test is
     complete. This time will be carried over between restarts in the save file,
     however the program will recognize an old savefile without total time and
     proceed accordingly. (Should it be printed to the results file?)

   - The "err = " prints the maximum error since the last checkpoint, as opposed
     to the maximum error since the last restart.
     There was a slight change to how maximum error is handled.

   - Now prints AID into results file, in a format that PrimeNet will
     understand. (Thanks James!) (Unfortunately, it seems that PrimeNet doesn't
     actually do anyhting with that AID.)

   - The first 1000 iterations now use extra error checking (same as -t), and
     also calculate average error. If average error >= 0.25, then the test will
     be restarted with a longer FFT length.

   - FFT selection should be somewhat better now, though not almost-perfect like
     Prime95. I did get a table of lengths from Prime95's tables.

   - Added mfakto's file locking code for results.txt. It should now be possible
     to run more than one instance in one directory with the -i option.

   - Changed "#ifdef linux" to "#ifndef _MSC_VER"
