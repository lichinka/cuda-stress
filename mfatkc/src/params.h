/*
SIEVE_SIZE_LIMIT is the maximum segment size of the sieve.
too small => to much overhead
too big => doesn't fit into (fast) CPU-caches
The size given here is in kiB (1024 bytes). A good starting point is the size
of your CPUs L1-Data cache.
This is just the upper LIMIT of the SIEVE_SIZE, the actual sieve size depends
on some other factors asweel, but you don't have to worry about.

/*
If MORE_CLASSES is defined than the while TF process is split into 4620
(4 * 3*5*7*11) classes. Otherwise it will be split into 420 (4 * 3*5*7)
classes. With 4620 the siever runs a bit more efficent at the cost of 10 times
more sieve initializations. This will allow to increase SIEVE_PRIMES a little
bit further.
This starts to become usefull on my system for e.g. TF M66xxxxxx from 2^66 to
2^67.

THREADS_PER_BLOCK has a hardware limit, 512 on GPUs with compute capability
1.x and 1024 on GPUs with compute capability 2.0. 
256 should be OK for most cases. Anyway there is usually no need to increase
THREADS_PER_BLOCK above 256 because if enough resources are available
(e.g. registers, shared memory) multiple blocks are launched at the same
time. When it is increased too much you might run out of register space
(especially on GPUs with compute capability 1.0 and 1.1)

GPU_SIEVE_PRIMES defines how far we sieve the factor candidates on the GPU.
The first <GPU_SIEVE_PRIMES> primes are sieved.

GPU_SIEVE_SIZE defines how big of a GPU sieve we use (in M bits).

GPU_SIEVE_PROCESS_SIZE defines how far many bits of the sieve each TF block processes (in K bits).
Larger values may lead to less wasted cycles by reducing the number of times all threads in a warp
are not TFing a candidate.  However, more shared memory is used which may reduce occupancy.
Smaller values should lead to a more responsive system (each kernel takes less time to execute).

The actual configuration is done in mfaktc.ini.
The following lines define the min, default and max value.
